# Day 1 - Setup & Variables Mastery

## Date: January 3, 2026 (Session ended 3:47 AM)

## What I Accomplished Today:

### Setup (100% Complete ✅)
- ✅ Installed Git and configured username/email
- ✅ Installed VS Code and learned to use it
- ✅ Installed Node.js (fixed "not recognized" error)
- ✅ Created GitHub repo: `60-day-gdg-prep`
- ✅ Learned Git workflow: clone, add, commit, push
- ✅ Set up Git Bash terminal
- ✅ Connected VS Code to GitHub with Personal Access Token

### Coding (Variables Module 100% Complete ✅)
- ✅ Ran my first JavaScript code with Node.js
- ✅ **MASTERED variables**: `const`, `let`, and why to avoid `var`
- ✅ **MASTERED template literals** with backticks and `${}`
- ✅ Understood objects and property modification
- ✅ Debugged multiple code issues independently
- ✅ Made connections between JavaScript and C++
- ✅ Tested my understanding with quiz (scored 100%)

### Files Created & Committed:
- `test.js` - First working code
- `day1-variables.js` - Variables practice and mastery
- `day1-notes.md` - This reflection document

## Challenges I Faced:
1. **Git Bash confusion** - Initially didn't understand the terminal interface
2. **Git configuration** - Email didn't show at first, had to reconfigure
3. **Quotes vs Backticks** - Spent time debugging `'${variable}'` vs `` `${variable}` ``
4. **Node.js installation** - Had to install Node.js to run JavaScript files
5. **GitHub authentication** - Learned to use Personal Access Token instead of password

## Key Lessons Learned:

### Technical:
- Setup always takes longer than expected - **that's normal!**
- Backticks (`` ` ``) work with `${variables}` for string interpolation
- Single/double quotes (`'` `"`) show literal text, not variable values
- Always save files before running (Ctrl + S)
- `const` for values that won't change (preferred default)
- `let` for values that will change
- `var` should be avoided (messy scoping)
- Objects with `const` can have their properties modified
- Always commit working code to GitHub

### Mindset:
- Debugging is part of coding - not a failure!
- Asking questions shows intelligence, not weakness
- Connecting new knowledge to what I know (C++) helps understanding
- Working late shows dedication, but sleep is also important
- Every error message is a learning opportunity

## What I Understand Deeply Now:

### Variables:
- **`const`** = cannot reassign the variable itself
- **`let`** = can reassign the variable
- **`const` objects** = can't reassign the object, but CAN change properties inside
- Example: `const student = {name: "Lucy"}; student.name = "Lucy End";` ✅ Works!

### Template Literals:
- Use backticks: `` `text here` ``
- Embed variables: `` `Hello ${name}` ``
- Better than concatenation: `"Hello " + name`

## Progress Today:
- **Day 1 Progress:** 40% complete (Setup ✅, Variables ✅, remaining: Arrow Functions, Array Methods, Final Notes)
- **Overall 60-Day Journey:** 8% complete

## Tomorrow I Will:
- Complete remaining Day 1 content:
  - Arrow functions (45 minutes)
  - Array methods: map, filter, reduce (60 minutes)
  - Finalize Day 1 notes
  - Commit everything
- Start Day 2: Async JavaScript & APIs

## How I Feel:
**Exhausted but incredibly proud!** 

Working until 3:47 AM shows my commitment to this goal. Setup was the hardest part and I pushed through every obstacle. I didn't just memorize syntax - I truly understood the concepts, especially the tricky parts about `const` objects.

I made real progress today. My code works. It's on GitHub. I debugged real issues. I feel like a developer.

**Tomorrow I continue. Today I sleep.** 😴
